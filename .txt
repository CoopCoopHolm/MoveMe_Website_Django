Joe: “I did some tweaks to the website. I found online that people make their webpages to 320px width minimum for those who are on phones or whatnot. It makes sure that the website looks the way you want it to even if it shrinks. Got most of the way done with the form pages too. They need some adjustments and I need to learn how to add an upload option as well for photos of their items and whatnot. Give all of the stuff a look and let me know what you think.”
